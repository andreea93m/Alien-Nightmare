# Alien-Nightmare

Developed as a group project for Computer Graphics (UE) at Johannes Kepler University, Summer 2015.

## Tasks

### Movie Concept

#### Scene 1
- [x] Cave
- [x] Fire
- [ ] Bloom effect
- [x] Flying bat
- [x] Polandballs around the fire
- [x] Lurking Alien

#### Scene 2
- [x] Warrior
- [x] Polandball
- [x] Warrior scares the Polandball

#### Scene 3
- [x] Dark room
- [x] Window
- [x] Spotlight
- [x] Jumping Polandballs
- [x] Alien outside the window

### Basic movie effects

- [x] Composed model 
	- [x] Add at least one composed model that consists of multiple parts (e.g., roboter with arms 
and legs). 
	- [x] Separate animation of different parts and animation (movement) of the model as a whole. 
- [x] Materials 
	- [x] At least two clearly different materials with specular properties (just setting different 
colors using glColor is not sufficient). 
- [x] Texturing 
	- [x] Apply texture to at least one manually created geometry (not simply loading an external 
model that contains the textures already). 
- [x] Illumination 
	- [x] Use multiple light sources (at least 1 moving). 
	- [x] Use at least 1 spot­light. 
- [x] Shader 
	- [x] Implement Phong shading that is applied to every object that is rendered (extend shader 
introduced in lab session with spot­light and texturing support). 
- [x] Transparency 
	- [x] At least one object must be semi­transparent and rendered in correct order. 
- [x] Camera 
	- [x] Use the keyboard to control forward (up­key) and backward movement (down­key) along 
the viewing direction and the mouse to control the heading (mouse­x) and pitch 
(mouse­y) of the camera relative to the ground (no roll!). 
	- [x] Additional animated camera flight.

### Special effects
- [ ] Postprocessing shader (bloom shader)
- [x] Particle system (fire)
